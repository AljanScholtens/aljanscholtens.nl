There are a lot of great meet-ups in Groningen like [PyGrunn](http://www.meetup.com/PyGrunn/), [SMC050](http://www.meetup.com/SMC050/), [Groningen.rb](http://www.meetup.com/Groningen-rb/), [Drupal Noord](http://www.meetup.com/Drupal-Noord-Meetup/) and more. But meet-ups for designers and front-end developers are hard to find.

That's why [Ron van de Graaf](https://twitter.com/ronvandegraaf) and I organized several meet-ups for this group of people last year. Within each session we watched video conference talks including those of [Aarron Walter](https://twitter.com/aarron) and [Mike Monteiro](https://twitter.com/monteiro). This led the evening to natural and good discussions. During these first trial sessions we invited people from HackerOne, Spindle, Blixx, Concept7 and Studio Wolf. After a few drinks it was clear to us this meet-up needed a follow-up. That's how Refresh was founded in the summer of 2015.

The goal of Refresh is to inspire each other and help us grow as designers and front-end developers. But the most important thing is to **bring these people together**. Because with different skills, specialties and insights the most beautiful collaborations and products can emerge.

To reach this goal we're going to make a pattern for the meet-up. Once per two months on a Tuesday evening is the regular Refresh meet-up with talks, video talks, discussions and beer on a changing location in Groningen. Also there will be a sporadic Refresh Special meet-up once in a while. Think of little hackathons, BBQ, book evenings or something else. With these two types of sessions we hope to mix inspiration, knowledge and sociable evenings.

[Tim](https://twitter.com/timsluis) started to tell this story in Amsterdam. It was received very well, especially by [Roel van de Wal](https://twitter.com/borq), owner of [Unc Inc](https://www.uncinc.nl/). This November they organized the first Refresh in Amsterdam.

Refresh is at the moment a closed meet-up, but that might change soon. Sign up via [meetup.com/refresh-groningen](http://meetup.com/refresh-groningen) or [meetup.com/refresh-amsterdam](http://meetup.com/refresh-amsterdam) and we'll let you in when we're ready. Nice to know: Refresh also has a Slack group to share experiences, knowledge and fun stuff.
