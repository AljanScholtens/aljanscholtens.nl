Once upon an ordinary Saturday, I wanted to continue reading the [biography of Steve Jobs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs_(book)). While reading, I realized that I still needed to print out concert tickets for [Katzenjammer](http://www.katzenjammer.no/) for that evening. But the ink had run out. While replacing the ink, I spilled it on my trousers. I quickly cleaned it up and printed the tickets.

I curled back up on the couch with the book and resumed reading on page 35. There, I read that Steve lets ink splatter on his books. A grin spread across my face. I grabbed my iPad to share it with my friends. Distracted.

On some days, it can be very difficult to read a book in peace. Everywhere around us, we are bombarded with stimuli and we want to [stay connected with the outside world](https://www.ted.com/talks/sherry_turkle_connected_but_alone).

To foster our primal creativity, it is important that we enter a state of [flow](https://www.ted.com/talks/mihaly_csikszentmihalyi_flow_the_secret_to_happiness). That is simply not possible if we are constantly distracted.

In the end, you are standing in your own way. **Only you can do something about the distraction that you create for yourself** by subjecting yourself to too many stimuli.

## Why Are We Distracted?

I think that distraction is, to a certain extent, beneficial. As human beings, we have **always been curious** about the events happening around us. That curiosity is what has made us great. That’s why we invented fire and the wheel (cliché ;-). The only problem is that if you are easily distracted, you become even more so. It’s like a downward spiral, because we always want more. That’s what happens with smartphones, tablets, etc.

## What Is the Solution?

Sometimes you let yourself get continuously distracted. That’s why it’s better to **preemptively disable as many stimuli as possible**. Think of notifications from Twitter and Facebook. Additionally, you can decide not to use digital devices in the evenings and on Sundays.

Earlier this year, I took it a step further. A small experiment: blocking Twitter and Facebook for one month. The interesting part was that for the first few days, I was quite nervous because I missed so much from my surroundings. When I was on the train or had to wait somewhere, I didn’t immediately know what to do. It was pretty tough, actually.

After a few days, however, that fortunately changed. While on the go, I would watch the scenery or be able to read undisturbed. On days when I was normally very distracted, I couldn’t work productively. The calm I regained was wonderful.

I can recommend this small experiment to everyone. It makes you reflect and brings you calm. Calm reduces stress and helps you better manage things, such as your work.

## Conclusion

Distraction is a natural phenomenon that we can do little about. It fosters our evolution and has made us who we are today: forward-thinking beings. The trick is to limit curiosity – that is, distraction – to a minimum. Otherwise, we overdo it and it works against us.

Too much distraction makes you dumb. Let’s **stay smart**.

Oh, and by the way, I’ve since finished the Steve book ;-)
