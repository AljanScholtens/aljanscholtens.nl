We slam the car doors shut, tie the laces of our mountain boots, throw our backpacks on our backs and set off towards the west. The 2016 hut tour is underway, we are hiking into the Karwendel Mountains of Austria.

In five days we walk from Vomp, near Innsbruck, in a round trip back to the starting point. Four mountain huts we will pass: the Lamsenjochhütte, the Falkenhütte, Karwendelhaus and Haulerangerhaus. Despite broken nights (we slept in dormitories with lots of snoring), the trek was relatively easy during the first three days. The fourth day it turned out there was a lot of ice on the summit so we walked an alternate route. The last day was a tough one where we expected to walk mostly downhill, but this was not the case at all.

A little photography tip for when walking in the mountains, or anywhere in nature. Look back once in a while, that's where you can often find the most beautiful spots, because the light can be totally different. This is especially true in the morning when the sun rises or in the evening when the sun sets. I took the photo below this way on the fourth day.

During the trip I brought my MeFoto tripod, Nisi filters, Canon 24mm F2.8 IS and Canon 70-200mm F4 IS, among other things. I wanted to see if I could take photos in the evening or morning at a hut during and after the golden hour. Often this was disappointing because you don't have a perfect location at every hut with the right subjects and besides, I have no control over the weather. I could have planned this better in advance. Still, I managed to get two good photos. The left picture was shot in the early morning at the Falkenhütte and the right picture I took during dinner (yes, my food got cold) at the Haulerangerhaus.
