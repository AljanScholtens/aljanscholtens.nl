My father on the left and my mother on the right — they support me as the three of us take a stroll through the large hall on the east side of the building. I hear people passing by, yet I feel alone. Alone with my parents. There isn’t even anyone else.

A sign, very close by — we walk past it. I ask my mother, “Is this sign yellow?” while she shakes her head and tells me that it’s red, bright red. Red is one of the colors that fades away the quickest when vision is impaired.

After that moment, I hear the sound of running water, but my parents hear nothing at all. Ten minutes later, we approach a large fountain on the other side of the UMCG — at least, that’s what I heard. My hearing has grown stronger and now takes over for my vision. My body is trying to compensate. Somehow, from afar, that even feels good.
