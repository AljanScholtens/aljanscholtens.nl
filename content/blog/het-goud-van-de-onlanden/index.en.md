title: The Gold of the Onlands
---

Once again I run up the stairs; this time to grab my tripod. I am in a hurry. The sky looks beautiful and I need to make it to the Onlands. I attach my Canon 24mm F2.8 to the camera, throw my backpack over my shoulder and walk to the car.

The moment I get in the car all sorts of thoughts spin through my head. Will I be in time for a nice sky? What's the best spot for a landscape photo tonight? Where do I park the car? Especially the first question always turns out to be a problem; nature does what it wants anyway.

I park the car on the north side of the Onlanden, near Peizermade. Then I walk over the bicycle bridge with the camera already clicked on my tripod to then walk into the familiar sandy path where often Bearded Grebes can be found.

The first one lands on my cheek, the second one flies with a speed right into my ear and makes a hell of a noise! The other thousands of siblings then pop up in front of me. It is one of those summer days in the swampy Onlanden, full of mosquitoes. One tip: ignore them, because you don't have much choice.

Unfortunately, the beautiful cloud cover soon disappears and I am left alone with the sun, thousands of mosquitoes and a clear blue sky that I can't do anything with. I decide to swap the wide-angle lens for the telephoto lens to up my bird photography game. While trying to photograph a bird the backlight through the reeds turns out to be really beautiful at 600mm. As a result, no landscape photos this evening, but nature photos with backlight from the late evening sun.
