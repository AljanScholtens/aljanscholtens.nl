Usually when I walk I am lost in thought. I see my surroundings but do not perceive it. For a long time I did not consciously realize this. By dealing with this consciously, I can walk with more peace and appreciation from time to time.

In the past I have often experienced busy periods, mostly thinking about work, private life, myself and much more. Then when I went for a walk, all kinds of thoughts would haunt my mind, thoughts that were of no use to me, but also thoughts over which I seemed to have little control. So I started to delve into the fact that I could well be addicted to thinking, which we all really are a bit. By reading several books on the subject, I actually almost automatically came up with the idea of consciously observing when I am walking it. In fact, it's a form of walking meditation, and yes, just with eyes open.

If normally while walking there is a kind of haze present, at least that's how I experience it, it's a different story when you start perceiving consciously. Look at the leaves flapping in the wind, a bird flying by and so on. Don't judge it, just observe it. And should a thought come into your mind about something you experienced while at work or something you still have to clean up when you get back home, that's fine. Observe this thought and let it pass. Do not condemn the thought, even if we are not the thought, it is normal to have them. Then bring your attention back to the nature around you.

In this way, sometimes you have a few seconds of absolute peace, and occasionally maybe even a few minutes. Longer really doesn't work for me, but that's fine. Although I sometimes thought otherwise in the past ;-)
