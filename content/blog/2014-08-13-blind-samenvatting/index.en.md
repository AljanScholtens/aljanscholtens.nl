It was February 2006 and I was about to take my exams as a 15-year-old at VMBO TL in Groningen. Slowly, I began to lose my sight. After an incorrect diagnosis by the general practitioner and a full day of tests at the hospital (blood tests, CT scan, neurological exam, spinal tap), I was sent home. That, however, was not enough.

Within three days, I was hooked up to an IV with the strongest dose of prednisone for adults at the UMCG. I couldn’t see anything anymore. After speaking with many doctors and undergoing numerous tests, my sight started to return after a few days. The symptoms never fully came back, though the fear of them has always lingered a bit.

Over the coming period, I will write short pieces about my memories of blindness—to get it off my chest and perhaps to help others.
