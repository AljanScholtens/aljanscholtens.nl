Every six months, I go on a multi-day hiking trip in the Netherlands with a friend of mine (Patrick). But this time, we wanted to go just across the border. That led us to the Hermanshöhen.

Less than an hour and a half in the car, and you find yourself in the beautiful Teutoburgerwald. It’s been over a year since we were there, but since I forgot to post the video on my blog—here it is.
