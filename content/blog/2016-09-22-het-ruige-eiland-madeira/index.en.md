At 01:00 in the night we get up, which is quite inhuman, and drive to Schiphol Airport. After a smooth flight, we land on the short runway of the flower island of Madeira. It has been less than a week since 8% of the island's nature burned down, so our trip feels a bit double. Still, we plan to make it a vacation without too many plans.

An hour later we drive on our way to our first night's stay, a Quinta in the northeastern part of the island. The landscape there is arid and dry, not many flowers to be found in this place. That evening we walk from the Quinta to the north side of the island (which is less than fifteen minutes walk) and arrive at beautiful cliffs where the rough sea laps against them. A setting sun, huge winds, but a beautiful location.

The next morning I wanted to explore the coast near the Quinta, so I got up around 6:30. Unfortunately no rising sun, it was overcast. Still managed to take a few photos with ND filter and just put myself as the subject.

The following days we noticed that the island is terribly diverse, something I had not expected at all. In the far east there are barren dry plains. Inland, the land is so green that it's like walking in a jungle. Above the tree line you get beautiful "steppes" and deep in the mountains you find hidden waterfalls. The only drawback on the island is the amount of construction; almost the entire coast is filled with mostly houses.

After 8 days of driving around the island in an old Renault Clio (which barely made it up the mountain) and staying overnight at 3 different Quintas, we can say that it is a beautifully diverse island. We mostly hiked through the rugged landscapes, drove narrow and steep roads and, of course, ate good food. It was an excellent vacation to recharge.
