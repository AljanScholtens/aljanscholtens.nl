My friends are organizing an annual Age of Empires 2 (AoE2) online tournament, [Age of Gamers](https://www.ageofgamers.nl), which was started during the pandemic. During this year's tournament, they introduced a mini competition: build something in Lego related to the strategy game Age of Empires 2. That's when I got excited.

I was hesitant about what to build, but eventually decided to dismantle my biggest set, [The Lion Knights Castle](https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/lion-knights-castle-10305) (10305). Perfect for a Donjon in Lego. I didn't use an online tool, so it was really about looking at the picture and building the Donjon brick by brick.

Initially, I started at the top, because I was afraid I wouldn't end up with the tower right, which is quite tricky. If you end up with 5 or 7 studs in a row, you're in trouble. I also wanted to make the Donjon foldable, like the Lion Knights Castle, but given my limited technical expertise and the limited time of the mini competition, I quickly abandoned this idea. Maybe next time.

It was fun to recreate something that (as far as I know) has not been made in Lego before. It was also the first time I built a MOC in Lego. It's certainly not perfect, but it's close enough for me. See below for some more pictures of the Donjon.
