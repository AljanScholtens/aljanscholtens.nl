photographing 54 dolmens for a book being written. Quite a lot of work and planning, but with the right preparation, it worked out.

First, I took notes on position, light and composition at almost all the dolmens. The most interesting hunebeds got a special note. There were also a number of hunebeds (especially in the Emmen area) that were simply too large to be photographed properly. At these dolmens I returned once more to photograph them with a drone.

Below is a small selection of the photos I took.
