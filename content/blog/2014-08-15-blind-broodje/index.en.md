I wake up after spending my first night at the UMCG. Within half an hour, the nurse comes by with my first hospital breakfast. I hear her cheerfully say good morning as she places a tray on the bedside table that now hovers over my bed. After thanking her, I grab a sandwich and take a bite. It’s dry, with no spread. I’m supposed to spread it myself, which I can’t do.
