As designers, we have to deal with clients’ expectations. Even before they approach you, they already have an idea of what the final product should be, even if they don’t realize it. This is human nature and is embedded in our subconscious.

These expectations are not always in our favor as designers. For example, you agree with the client to discuss the project. A few weeks later, you present the Photoshop design (or [browser design](http://www.studiowolf.nl/notes/weg-met-photoshop/ "Down with Photoshop?")). The client responds by saying that he finds it terrible. So, you end up back at the drawing board.

The fact that the client thinks it’s terrible is **our fault**. It is our job to introduce the client to the world of the web. We know the best ways to handle flows, layout, and branding. That’s why involving the client in a solid process is crucial—it sets the proper expectations.

Our clients are involved in almost every part of the design process. Consider the following components:

- Brainstorm
- Card sorting
- Explaining flows
- Defining the structure
- Sketches
- Mood board
- Prototype (final product)
- Design in HTML/CSS

The most important elements for tempering preconceived expectations are the sketches and the mood board. Sketches indicate what the layout of the pages will be, while the mood board is a kind of digital collage where we convey the intended feel of the website. Think of it as covering the design of individual elements, such as buttons, photography, headers, as well as the chosen colors, typography, and project-specific elements. This helps the client to envision a new picture of the final product.

## Mood Board Examples

*2013 – ParnasSys*

*2011 – Ethnic Chic*

*2009 – Aquaverium*

Because the client sees the sketches and the mood board separately, a new set of expectations is automatically created that aligns with the final product.

Before we used mood boards, designs were often rejected due to mismatched expectations. Since August 2009, we have created approximately **105 mood boards**, and since then, not a single one has been rejected.

It turns out that when we, as designers, practice expectation management, we create more efficient and better collaborations, ultimately leading to a stronger final result for everyone.
