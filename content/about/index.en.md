Hi, I'm Aljan, a landscape photographer. I wander in the great outdoors to capture nature at its best. I live in Groningen, the northern part of the Netherlands, but I am often traveling to other destinations.

Oh, and most of the time, besides my camera gear and good behaviour, I bring my [Small Münsterlander Nikki](https://www.instagram.com/munsterlandernikki/) on my photography trips.

## Why?

In the last decade we are disconnecting ourselves from nature. Social media, smartphones, and other distractions are partly the reason why we have trouble focusing and enjoying nature—including myself. I want to **reconnect** people just a little bit with nature and with themselves through my photography.

## How did I become a landscape photographer?

My grandfather forged my enthusiasm for nature at a young age. He told me about the local birds, landscapes, and villages. When I reached the age of 15, I got to use my father's Pentax ME Super SLR, which now sits in a cabinet alongside 10 other analogue cameras.

Within two years, I bought my own Canon EOS 350D and began taking photos of shopping carts, flowers, cats, people, and landscapes. Mainly, landscapes caught my attention, but in the early days I had real issues with the technical side of photography and became frustrated. Years later I picked up the camera again and got really excited.

I spent the last ten years as the co-owner of a design agency, creating digital products. Alongside this business, my enthusiasm for landscape photography grew, and I decided to become a landscape photographer. We live in a world where you can try different things when the time is right.

Nowadays I travel a lot for landscape photography to destinations such as Scotland, Iceland, Norway, Austria, Italy, New Zealand, and of course The Netherlands. For me, there is nothing better than being outside and capturing captivating photos. A nice morning outside without taking photos is still a nice morning outside. Nature never abandons us, as long as we're open to it.

The most important aspect in my search for great landscape photography is purity. With my photos, I want to fascinate people—to get outside, appreciate and cherish nature, and to show them how it really is. This search is never complete, but every small step is a step in the right direction.

## Gear

Last year I switched from Canon to Sony, so below is my new gear. I also have a small museum at home with very old analogue cameras. Sometimes I even use my old Pentax lenses on my Sony camera.

- **Sony A7III**: I love this camera; the sensor is just amazing.
- **Sony 70-200mm f4 G**: A wonderful lens—I shoot most landscape photos with this lens.
- **Sony 24-70mm f2.8 GM**: A perfect all-round lens; I also film my YouTube videos with this lens.
- **Sony 85mm f1.8**: Very good for the price; I use this lens when shooting portraits.
- **Atlas Athlete backpack**: Like most landscape photographers, I'm always searching for the perfect backpack—this one comes really close.
- **Benro Mach3 Tripod**: Close to home, I use this very sturdy and lightweight tripod.
- **Leofoto travel tripod**: When hiking long distances, I use this small and extremely portable travel tripod.
- **Nisi V5 Filters**: I use some ND filters, graduate filters, and of course a polariser.
- **RRS L-bracket**: A perfect L-bracket for a Sony camera; it lets my thumb stay on the camera.
- **DJI Mavic Pro**: My compact drone that I often take with me.
- **Canon Pro-1000 Printer**: Because printing a photo is one of the best things you can do.
