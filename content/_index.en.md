## What am I doing?

- Raising my five-year-old son and baby daughter!
- Full focus on building [Wolf Maps](https://www.wolfmaps.com/). A tool to create beautiful and shareable maps. [Get in touch](/contact) if you want to know more.
- I am in the process of creating a multi-day hiking trail in the area where I live. The progress is [viewable in Wolf Maps](https://wolfmaps.nl/kaart/route-du-drenthe-7b975eb).
- Just finished [a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2MwUVcXqPg) about hiking the Hermannshöhen in Germany. Currently I am finishing up a video of the Schladminger Tauern.
- I am working on a book with my best [landscape photos](/gallery). I expect to finish it in the winter of 2024/2025. [Sneak peek](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/aljanscholtens_ken-je-dat-gevoel-dat-je-zo-veel-leuke-activity-7183480484998356992-aj4o?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop).
- I occasionally post landscape photos on [Instagram](https://instagram.com/aljan).
- I post pictures of our [Kleine Münsterländer Nikki](http://www.instagram.com/munsterlandernikki/) on Instagram. She is sweet, stubborn and enthusiastic!
